# Customized Wordle
A simple wordle built in html, css and javascript. Doesn't have animations.

## HOW TO USE
download all files except readme.md, 
put all downloaded files in one separate folder, 
open that folder in visual studio code, 
right click in the index.html code > open with live server (you need the live server extension), 
enjoy

## CHANGE THE AMOUNTS OF GUESSES YOU HAVE
go into the code of script.js and edit the variable "NUMBER_OF_GUESSES" to the amount of guesses you want to have

## KNOWN BUGS
yellow or green letters aren't matching the wordle mechanics when there's multiple of the same letter - works fine if the word has multiple of the same letter and you guess a word with multiple of those letters - doesn't work well if you guess a word with multiple of the same letter AND the word doesn't have more than 1 of that letter in the word
