# Customized Wordle
A simple wordle built in html, css and javascript. This is a project for me to learn Javascript.

## MAIN FEATURES
- Animate.css animations + fireworks on correct guess
- Ability to change the number of guesses you have (1-30)
- Ability to change the word length (3 - 16 letter words)
- Optional time limit to find the word (+ optional: bonus time for yellow & green letters, penalty for grey letters)
- Optional time limit to make a guess
- Easily change the color of nearly everything without editing the code
- Restart easily as many times as you want (+ option to Auto-Restart after correct guesses)
- No limitations in any way, feel free to use the source code, but if you do, I would be happy if you at least mentioned my name. Thanks!

## HOW TO USE - INSTALLATION GUIDE
